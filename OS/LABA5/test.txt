1In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the
ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit
3down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass
1knob in the e||x||act middle. The door opened on to a tubeshaped hall like a tunnel: a very
comfortable tunnel without smoke, with pane3lled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted,2
provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit
was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into
6the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many
little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going
upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes
(he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same
7floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side
(going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows
looking over his garden and mea5dows beyond, sloping down to the river.
This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had
lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them
very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never
had any adventures or did anything une||x||pected: you could tell what a Baggins would
say on any question without the bother of asking him
